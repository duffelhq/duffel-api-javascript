Airline credits may have expiration dates which are based on the date of issue. Airlines don't always reliably disclose the expiration date in their APIs at the time of cancellation, so we are unable to return this information on airline credits. To get the latest info on expiration dates for airline credits we recommend checking directly with the airlines to determine the specific conditions of use for the credit.
